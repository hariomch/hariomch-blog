Log analysis is a valuable asset when it comes to IT system management and monitoring. It plays a crucial role in troubleshooting issues which can impact peroformace, compliance and security of a system.

This post covers what log analysis is, its importance, tools and how to perform log analysis.

### What is Log Analysis
Log analysis is the process of reviewing, interpreting and understanding computer-generated records called logs. Logs are generated by a range of programmable devices, applications, opeating systems, etc. A log consists of a series of messages in time-sequence that describe activities going on within a system. 


### Why analyze logs?
Log analysis provides useful metrics that paint a clear picture of what has happened across the infrastructure. Logs must regularly monitored and analyzed to search for errors, anomalies, or suspicious or unauthorized activity that deviates from the norm. Log analysis allows companies to re-create the chain of events that led up to a problem and effectively troubleshoot it.

From a security point of view Log analysis serves several different purposes:
- To comply with internal security policies and outside regulations and audits
- To understand and respond to data breaches and other security incidents
- To troubleshoot systems, computers, or networks
- To conduct forensics in the event of an investigation

### How to Perform Log Analysis
Since logs messages generated by applications, operating systems, devices, alanyzing them become a complex process. A log analysis software is be used to ease the process. Here is basic five-step process for managing logs with log analysis software: 

1. **Instrument and collect** - install a collector to collect data from any part of your stack.
2. **Centralize and index** - integrate data from all log sources into a centralized platform to streamline the search and analysis process. Indexing makes logs searchable, so security and IT personnel can quickly find the information they need.
3. **Search and analyze** - Analysis techniques such as pattern recognition, normalization, tagging and correlation analysis can be implemented either manually or using native machine learning.
4. **Monitor and alert** - With machine learning and analytics, IT organizations can implement real-time, automated log monitoring that generates alerts when certain conditions are met. Automation can enable the continuous monitoring of large volumes of logs that cover a variety of systems and applications.
5. **Report and dashboard** - Streamlined reports and dashboarding are key features of log analysis software. Customized reusable dashboards can also be used to ensure that access to confidential security logs and metrics is provided to employees on a need-to-know basis.


### Log Analysis Functions and Methods
Log analysis functions manipulate data to help users organize and extract information from the logs. Here are just a few of the most common methodologies for log analysis. 

- **Normalization** - normalization is a data management technique wherein the messages are converted to the same format. The process of centralizing and indexing log data should include a normalization step where attributes from log entries across applications are standardized and expressed in the same format.

- **Pattern Recognition** - machine learning applications can now be implemented with log analysis software to compare incoming messages with a pattern book and distinguish between "interesting" and "uninteresting" log messages. Such a system might discard routine log entries, but send an alert when an abnormal entry is detected.

- **Classification and Tagging** - as part of our log analysis, we may want to group together log entries that are the same type. We may want to track all of the errors of a certain type across applications, or we may want to filter the data in different ways.

- **Correlation Analysis** - when an event happens, it is likely to be reflected in logs from several different sources. Correlation analysis is the analytical process of gathering log information from a variety of systems and discovering the log entries from each individual system that connect to the known event.

### Log analysis tools
Some tools to analyze logs are:
- Splunk
- Sumo Logic
- Logz.io
- Logstash
